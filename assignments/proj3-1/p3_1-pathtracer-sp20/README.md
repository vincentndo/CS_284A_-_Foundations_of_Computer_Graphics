You have a total of 5 slip days to use on assignments throughout the semester, but you do not have slip days for checkpoint quizzes. Assignments submitted after 11:59PM are considered a full day late. There are no late minutes or late hours. After you have used all 5 slips days, you will lose 10% for each day you submit an assignment late.

Your final assignment submission must include **both** your code and write-up. Please consult this article on [how to submit assignment for CS184](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp20/article/15/submitting-cs184-assignments).

You can find the specifications and instructions [here (Assignment 3-1: Pathtracer)](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp20/article/20/assignment-3-1-pathtracer)
